            <p>Once you have logged in, it’s time to update your profile. Users are much more likely to be interested in a performer if they get to know you a little bit. 
            <br/><br/>

            Click on your user name in the upper right hand corner, and from the dropdown menu choose “profile.” This will take you to your dashboard where you can add personal info, update your schedule, upload photos and videos to your galleries, and check your earnings.

          <div class="collapsible-body">
          <p>
            This is what every model wants to know. You may have gotten people into your room, but how do you keep them there? While there is no guarantee that users will stay, here are some tips to optimize your viewers’ experience.
              <br/><br/>
              -Respond to users’ messages. This seems like a no-brainer, but yes, your viewers want to know that you’re real and are present with them.<br/><br/>
              -Make sure your camera is positioned close to you for the best interaction. We recommend you have your microphone enabled, because your viewers want to hear your sexy voice.<br/><br/>
              -Make sure you are well lit! A haunted house is fun on Halloween, but most viewers want to see you, not a ghost. If there’s little to no daylight, position your lights to illuminate you. A good, flattering light can come from two lights, one positioned in front of you on either side. Put them behind the camera so they don’t create glare.<br/><br/>
              -Play dress up. Have some fun with your costume. If you’re playing a part, have some props to make the experience more believable. If you’re a French maid, don a frilly hat and a feather duster. Have fun and get creative!
