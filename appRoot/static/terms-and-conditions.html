    <h1>Terms And Conditions</h1>
    <p class='date'>Effective Date: Aug 1, 2016</p>


    <h2>Adults only.</h2>

    <p>We have placed this detail over and above all of our other terms because it is the most important (although it is also referenced below). Please note that the {{domainName}} platform is only open to consenting adults looking to express themselves in the form of streaming video and messaging. We have zero tolerance for any minors on the {{domainName}} platform, whether such individuals are actually minors or pretending to be minors perhaps in a misguided attempt at role-play. Moreover, we have zero tolerance for any image of any minor being uploaded to our platform for any reason. Please be advised that we reserve the right to and do report each and every suspected minor to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and any and all other law enforcement agencies we feel appropriate. If you believe that a minor is using the site, we request and encourage members to report each and every user he or she encounters which he or she believes or suspects to be under the age of eighteen. All reports are reviewed within minutes of our receipt, if not seconds. If you are a minor, you must immediately leave this site now. You are not legally permitted on {{siteName}} for any reason, and if we find you on this site, we will report you to law enforcement as mentioned above. We will not reactivate you for any reason ever.<br>
    <br>
    With respect to all other matters, we have attempted to keep our rules to a minimum only imposing those we feel are necessary for the safety of our users and the continued operation of {{domainName}}.</p>

        	<ol>
        		<li>You are not prohibited by law from using the Service and that you have the right, authority and capacity to enter into this Agreement and to abide by all of its Terms and Conditions as posted here and as amended from time to time.</li>
        		<li>You are familiar with the laws in your area that may affect your legal right to access erotica or adult-oriented material, and you have the legal right to access such material and the Site has the legal right to transmit such material to you in your location;</li>
        		<li>You understand that, through use of the Service, you will be exposed to visual images, verbal descriptions audio sounds and other features and/or products of a sexually oriented, frankly erotic nature, which may include graphic visual depictions and descriptions of nudity and sexual activity, and you are voluntarily choosing to do so, because you want to view, read and/or hear the various materials and/or order and enjoy the use of such products or features, which are available, for your own personal enjoyment, information and/or education;</li>
        		<li>Your choice to use the Service is a manifestation of your interest in sexual matters which, you believe, are both healthy and normal and which, in your experience, is generally shared by average adults in your community.</li>
        		<li>You are familiar with the standards in your community regarding the acceptance of such sexually oriented materials, and the materials you expect to encounter through use of the Service are within those standards;</li>
        		<li>In your judgment, the average adult in your community accepts the consumption of such materials by willing adults, in circumstances such as those under which the Service is provided, offering reasonable insulation from the materials for minors and unwilling adults, and will not find such materials to appeal to a prurient interest or to be patently offensive.</li>
        		<li>It is your desire to share and/or to invite others to share your own private and personal behaviors and to comment, rate, criticize, organize and recommend based on what you are exposed to, by utilizing the Services, while inviting others to do the same.</li>
        		<li>You have not notified any governmental agency, including the U.S. Postal Service, that you do not wish to receive sexually oriented material.</li>
        		<li>The Site provides access to an online service comprising information and materials created and posted, uploaded, or streamed by you and other users (each a "<strong>Contributor</strong>").</li>
        		<li>Video and images on the Site that are available for viewing (collectively, the "<strong>Content</strong>") are stored on or streamed through our servers at the direction of our users.</li>
        		<li>Any modification of the Content that is uploaded or streamed by our users, such as the addition of a watermark, is performed by an automated process. Accordingly, as the Contributor is aware that such modifications shall take place automatically upon transmission, the Contributor shall be deemed the party responsible for such automatic modification and shall be considered the "author" of such automatically modified Content. The Site is not responsible for modifications that occur to Content as part of its automatic transmission process.</li>
        		<li>Any review of uploaded or streamed Content that may be performed by the Site before or after making such Content available to the public is cursory and only intended to identify immediately obvious violations of this Agreement. Accordingly, and despite any such gate keeping, the Contributor uploading or streaming any Content shall be deemed the party at whose direction that Content is available to others through use of the Service.</li>
        		<li>The Site has never directed, and never will direct, its users to upload or stream Content that infringes upon any right belonging to a third party. Uploading or streaming Content that infringes on third-party rights constitutes a direct and material violation of this Agreement and will subject the uploading or streaming Contributor's account to suspension and/or termination, where appropriate.</li>
        		<li>The Site correctly presumes that the Contributor uploading or streaming any Content is the sole holder of all exclusive rights to that Content, except where the Content alone bears some obvious indication to the contrary, such as a visible proprietary marking identifying a person or entity other than the Contributor as the exclusive rights holder.</li>
        		<li>Where Content has no obvious proprietary marking that indicates an exclusive owner, the Site cannot be deemed to have actual knowledge that such Content infringes upon any third party's rights.</li>
        		<li>The Site has no right or ability to control the activities of Contributors who create, post, upload, or stream Content through the Site. In the event that a Contributor infringes upon a third party's rights by creating, posting, uploading, or streaming Content, that Contributor is the sole responsible party for such infringement, and the Site has no control over such activity.</li>
        		<li>Apart from identifying an obvious proprietary marking in any Content that indicates an exclusive owner, the Site has no other ability to determine whether the rights appurtenant to a particular piece of Content may belong to a party other than the uploading or streaming Contributor. As the Site's only other means of identifying Content that may infringe upon a third party's rights, the Site relies entirely on properly presented notifications from third parties claiming that their rights have been violated.</li>
        	</ol>
    	</li>
    	<li>Notice of Intellectual Property Infringement. The Site respects the intellectual property of others, and we ask our members and others to do the same.

        		<li>Tipping is done at your own option and risk. Tipping is not required for use of the Service.</li>
        		<li>Tipping may only be done using Virtual Money. Contributors may not solicit tips though means of payment other than Virtual Money.</li>
        		<li>Tips are a voluntary gratuity and may not be given in exchange for specific services. Promising to give a tip in exchange for performance of any act is strictly prohibited, and such conduct will result in an immediate and lifetime ban from use of the Service.</li>

        		<li>Tipping does not alter our code of conduct. Giving or receiving tips in exchange for actual or promised conduct in violation of this Agreement is prohibited.</li>
